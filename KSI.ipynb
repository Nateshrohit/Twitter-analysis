      "\n",
      "3441)  yes, jake should fight a pro boxer, but if you saw the “pro” that ksi fought last weekend you know that doesn’t always mean much.  silva will absolutely, positively be his most difficult opponent jake has faced to date and the step up in competition is what’s most important…\n",
      "\n",
      "3442)  ksi has a fighting style and he’s use to it. you can’t tell him how to fight so long as it’s not purposely exploiting the rules. throwing a wild over hand is not exploiting it. look at deontay wilder.\n",

      "3446)  but in my opinion jake really isn't on a higher level than ksi because he really hasn't boxed anyone either. jake i cannot call a boxer yet until he faces a boxer. tommy at least fights other boxers. jake hasn't proven himself anymore than ksi.\n",

      "\n",
      "3455)  see, i think kenny is the better boxer, but because sensei got 'bigger' hits in, it looks like sensei was better. right now i think deji actually put up the best performance, followed by kenny and then ksi. honestly, right now, i think deji is a better boxer than ksi. -\n",
